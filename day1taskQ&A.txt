q1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication

HTTP/1.1:
It is the first standardized version of HTTP, was introduced in 1997.
It presented significant performance optimizations (over HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0) and 
transformed the way requests and responses were exchanged between clients and servers.
It works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2:
 At the beginning of 2010, Google introduced an experimental protocol, SPDY,
 which supported multiplexing (multiple requests/responses sent and received asynchronously over a single TCP connection)
 but as it gained traction IETF’s HTTP Working Group came up with HTTP/2 in 2015, which is based on the SPDY protocol.
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
It uses HPACK for data compression.
